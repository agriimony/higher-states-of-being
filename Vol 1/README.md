# Volume 1

Volume 1 was inspired by classical paintings
The style and direction was very much influenced by muted dark tones and vintage fades 
The models all wear astronaut helmets (reminiscent of going higher) and are swaddled in various clothes - mostly taking inspiration from bohemian culture with large oversized cloths and scarves

Prompts were made using DALL-E 3 via Bing Image Creator
Images were then edited to include the title text, and minor touchups in photoshop
