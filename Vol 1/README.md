# Volume 1

### Inspiration
Volume 1 takes inspiration from classical paintings. The style and direction was very much influenced by muted dark tones and vintage fades. 

### Fashion
The models all wear astronaut helmets (reminiscent of going higher) and are swaddled in various clothes - mostly taking inspiration from bohemian culture with large oversized cloths and scarves. Some models were dressed in modern streetwear, just to play around with the juxtaposition of the tones with the attire and style.

### Instructions
