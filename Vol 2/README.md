# Volume 1
### Inspiration

Volume 2 takes inspiration from cyberpunk, anime, street fashion

Aside from the astronaut helmets, a learning from Vol 1 is to make their poses more dynamic
You will see more expressive facial expressions and poses as they aspire to be higher
Clothes are also sharper, with messier brushstrokes and grunge type textures

### Instructions

* Prompts were made using DALL-E 3 via ChatGPT 4.0
* Images were then edited to include the title text, and minor touchups in photoshop

### Minting

Another lesson from Vol 1 is not to drag out mints too long in this early stage
Unlike Vol 1, all 4 tiers will be released together, at the same price of 420 $HIGHER
Holding more HIGHER allows one to mint more if they want (1 per tier)
